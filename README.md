## Content Troubleshooting

### Geometry

| Name | Symptom | Cause | Solutions |
| - | - | - | - |
| **Z-Fighting** | Flickering polygons | Multiple polys have equal Z-depth in the same pixel | - Make sure no polygons overlap on the same plane<br>- Increase near clip distance in camera |
| **Aliased lines** | Thin geo like cables or fences jitters, disappears | Geometry is thinner than a single pixel | - Make LODs with thicker geo, different texture<br>- Blend to a solid texture at far distance<br>- Use a different anti-aliasing algorithm |
| **Visibility culling** | Mesh or particle system disappearing from certain positions | Frustum or occlusion culling hides objects by their bounding boxes | - Check if occluders (geometry) are correct<br>- Increase bounding box size |
| **Flipped normals** | Mesh is inverted or partially invisible | Back faces of triangles are hidden by default (backface culling) | - Flip (reverse)  vertex normals to face outside<br>- If both sides needed, enabled two-sided rendering in material |
| **Temporal anti-aliasing** | Meshes are blurry when moving | Temporal smoothing algorithms combine multiple frames over time for high quality | - Make sure game keeps good, stable framerate, high resolution<br>- If using vertex displacement in shader, add motion vectors support<br> - For stability but lower quality, switch to FXAA anti-aliasing |
| **Split edges** | Holes appear in animated mesh | Vertices have two modes: shared or split | - Merge vertices in your 3d software<br>- Lock vertex normals instead of physically splitting edges<br>- Use auto smooth groups |
| **Import scale** | Model is huge or tiny after importing | Different editors use 1 cm or 1 m as base unit | -Make sure to follow correct physical dimensions when modelling<br>- Set import or export scale to 0.01 or 100x<br> |

### Materials

| Name | Symptom | Cause | Solutions |
| - | - | - | - |
| **Bilinear mipmap filtering** | Blurry textures at oblique angles | Bilinear filtering in perspective projection underestimates required mipmap level of a texture | - Use anisotropic texture filtering, if performance tradeoff is acceptable |
| **Negative or NaN color** | Black or deeply saturated squares on screen | Pixel’s color value is negative or not a number. This corrupts some algorithms (bloom) | - Check for division-by-zero in shaders<br>- Clamp values to [0,1] in shaders |
| **Edge bleeding** | Colors from another island of UV space bleeding into the borders of given one | Bilinear texture filtering picks up information from neighboring texels, as it's unaware of UV seams or image atlas items | - Increase margins between UV islands<br>- Add 1 pixel of space between items in tileset/atlas<br>- In Substance Painter, use `Dilation` mode when exporting |
| **Alpha bleeding** | White edges in textures with transparency | https://ciechanow.ski/alpha-compositing/ | - In Substance Painter, use `Dilation` mode when exporting<br> -In Photoshop, fill the background by selecting alpha mask, inverting selection and use Fill > Content Aware<br>- Respect premultiplied alpha in shaders |
| **Banding in textures** | Stepped gradients in textures | Lossy compression can’t represent subtle gradient | - Use more contrast in your source textures (e.g. stronger normal map), then reduce it in shader |
| **Banding in display** | Stepped gradients on screen | Transition between certain colors can’t be represented, due to display’s color precision | - Add some film grain<br>- Use dithering<br>- Check if your post-process stack has HDR until very end |
| **Aliasing** | Moire patterns, bloom flickering | Resolution is not dense enough to represent (aka sample) the content | - Use smoother patterns in textures<br>- Add soft radius to light sources<br>- Blend to smoother texture by distance<br>- Use different anti-aliasing algorithm |
| **sRGB vs linear** | Textures are too dark or washed out after import, or roughness is wrong | Textures come in (at least) two formats: linear color or sRGB. Linear is used for data, while sRGB for human-readable color | - In texturing programs, export albedo/diffuse as sRGB<br>- In game engine, enable  `sRGB` in albedo/diffuse textures<br>- Disable sRGB (use linear) for data (roughness, masks) |
| **Normal Y-axis sign** | Normal map looks inverted | Some engines expect Y+ axis to mean "down", while others consider it "up" | - Invert green channel of normal map<br>-In Unreal, tick `Flip Green Channel` in texture |
| **Hard normals on foliage** | Flat shading on foliage models, harshly disconnected from terrain | Foliage mesh, made of big flat planes, is interpreted too literally by lighting | - Use manually edited, up-pointing vertex normals<br>- Read normal from terrain |
| **Half precision** | Pixelated procedural materials on mobile | Mobile devices optimize some values by storing them in 16 bits instead of 32 | - Make your effects less dependent on precision (smooth flow maps, bigger features on texture)<br>- Use modulo (%, fmod) on final time and UVs<br>- Force full precision on variable  |

### Transparency 
| Name | Symptom | Cause | Solutions |
| - | - | - | - |
| **Bad sorting of polygons** | Triangles of meshes or particles appear in wrong order | Game engines employ per-object sorting instead of per-triangle, for speed | - Split big objects into smaller ones<br>- Move pivot closer to center of mesh<br>- Use dithered opacity or cutout alpha for semi-solid objects<br>- Hack: change draw priority (render queue) of shader |
| **Depth of field post process** | Transparent objects are not affected by depth of field | DoF reads the depth of the scene to perform blur. Translucent materials don't write single depth | - Deal with it<br>- In Unreal, enable Separate Translucency in material |

### Lighting

| Name | Symptom | Cause | Solutions |
| - | - | - | - |
| **Lightmap bleeding** | Dark or wrong mesh edges | Bilinear filtering picks up information from neighboring texels | - Increase margins between UV islands |
| **Overlapping polygons** | Black spots in lightmaps | Multiple triangles are baked to the same texel | - Make sure no UV islands overlap<br>- Remove any overlapping geo in mesh & level<br>- Check for duplicate objects in level |
| **Missing reflection probes** | Black reflections on metals | Lack of reflection sources | - Make sure at least 1 reflection probe covers every area in the scene |
| **Movable SkyLight** (UE4) | Black reflections on metals | SkyLight or all reflection probes have `Mobility` set to `Movable` | - Change their `Mobility` to `Static` |
| **Shadow acne** | Stepped shadows at certain angles | Shadow map’s resolution is not enough to represent the continuous surface | - Play with shadow bias parameter in light’s settings<br>- Increase shadow map resolution |
| **Dynamic lights limit** | Flickering lights | Renderer reached a limit of light sources affecting the same pixel | - Reduce # of lights overlapping in that place (change radius, move, delete)<br>- Use static (baked) lights instead |

### Animation

| Name | Symptom | Cause | Solutions |
| - | - | - | - |
| **Root motion** | Character "swims" or drifts far from pivot over time | Root bone transform in animation is updated to match character movement in game | - Fix the loop, making sure it ends where it started<br>- Disable root motion |

### Physics

| Name | Symptom | Cause | Solutions |
| - | - | - | - |
| **Tick rate** | Fast objects fly through, skipping collision | Physics frame rate was not sufficient for the system to detect collision | - Use thicker collider<br>- Enable continuous collision detection (CCD) |
